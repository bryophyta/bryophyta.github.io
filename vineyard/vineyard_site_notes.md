	Following conversation earlier, have been experimenting with some different ways of adding panels which carry more text, with also the function of leading interested readers onto other pages with more in-depth info.

	* Added three different styles/layouts, customising them to the current 'theme' of the page.
	* They are supposed to be more illustrative than anything else. We need to see whether these are along the right sort of lines, then think about how to incorporate them into the flow of the page as a whole.
		* The copywriting might also be something to think about here, e.g. I'm inclined to think at the moment that we don't want to just be repeating the page titles over and over, so maybe the panel titles should be different (though obviously connected..)


	Been playing around a bit more with some of the styling.

	* Trying out the 'Amatic' font for headings. Softens the vibe a bit, and I think it works reasonably well with the sleeker font being used in the body. 
		* Need to experiment with other combinations though.
		* Also the header menu styling needs some thought; Amatic or similar *might* work for sub-headings, but I doubt it'll work for the main site header..
	* Also experimenting with more 'hand drawn' divider lines, for e.g. the 'Our Wines' section. (Literally hand draw here, just something I did myself v quickly, need to try out some more polished alternatives.)
		* If we like the idea, both waves and vines might lend themselves as a theme to divider lines (though wouldn't want to go overboard).


	Edited the footer a bit to make it more straightforwardly about the information, but tbh I have very little idea what to do with the footer more broadly, at the moment.
		* So I need to think about this.

	Mainly getting a feel for how the Wix editor works. 

	* Changed the style and the behaviour of the top menu a bit.
	* Added the three-panel 'teaser' strip: 'About Us', 'About the Vineyard', 'Tours & Tastings'
	* Changed other bits of styling etc.
