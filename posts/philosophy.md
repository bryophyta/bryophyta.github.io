# Philosophy

I completed my PhD in Philosophy at UCL (University College London) in 2019. I'm
interested in a range of questions in philosophy, as well as psychology,
feminist theory, and the social sciences, especially social & cultural
anthropology. But most of my writing in philosophy has centred on the nature of
social practices, and how they can explain human action, often without our
awareness.

I don't get so much time these days for philosophy, but I'm always happy to chat
about it, if anything I've worked on happens to be of interest to you! And if
you can't get access to any of these papers, please feel free to get in touch.
