     <p class="main-text">In Spring term of 2018, I delivered a term-long tutorial class on the topic of ‘The Mind and the Social World’ to small groups of third-year undergraduates at UCL. I designed the course with three aims in mind. The first was to introduce some core debates in social ontology, in particular the different ways in which the social world has been thought to depend on human minds. The second was to link these more ‘foundational’ questions to broader implications for social science and social change. The third was to encourage the students to consider these philosophical questions in relation to work in the social sciences. To facilitate this, many weeks included, as additional readings, classic works in anthropology or sociology which engage to some degree with the philosophical literature on these topics.</p>
