        <h2 id="of-superstition-and-enthusiasm">‘Of Superstition and Enthusiasm’</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Two distinct “corruptions of true religion” (OSE 73).</li>
            <li>Hume distinguishes them in terms of their psychological origins:
                <ul>
                    <li>Superstition arises from ‘weakness, fear, melancholy, together with ignorance’ (74).</li>
                    <li>Enthusiasm arises from ‘hope, pride, presumption, a warm imagination, together with ignorance’ (74).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Three key ‘reflections’ in the essay:
                <ul>
                    <li>Superstition is more ‘favourable to priestly power’ (75-76).</li>
                    <li>Superstition is more stable over time; enthusiasm begins more intensely, but the intensity is more short-lived (76-78).</li>
                    <li>Superstition is “an enemy to civil liberty”, whereas enthusiasm is “a friend to it” (78-79).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section></article>
    <article class="slide">
        <header class="slide-header"><h1 id="background-1">Background</h1></header><section>
        <p>On Hume’s second reflection (relative stability of superstition):</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>When the first fire of enthusiasm is spent, men naturally […] sink into the greatest remissness and coolness in sacred matters; <mark>there being no body of men among them</mark>, endowed with sufficient authority, whose interest is concerned to support the religious spirit: <mark>No rites, no ceremonies, no holy observances</mark>, which may enter into the common train of life, and preserve the sacred principles from oblivion. (‘Of Superstition and Enthusiasm’ 77-78)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Hume highlights the role of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Priests. Important for Hume (and connects his three reflections), but I will largely bracket their role.</li>
            <li>‘Rites, ceremonies, holy observances’ (I will call these ‘religious practices’).</li>

        <header><h1 id="two-questions-about-religious-practice">Two questions about religious practice</h1></header><section>
        <p>Two questions raised by Hume’s remarks about religious practice in ‘Of Superstition and Enthusiasm’:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Why is it that religious practices can tend to sustain or increase religious belief?</li>
            <li>Why should this phenomenon be particularly associated with superstitious religion?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>(Unfortunately I don’t have time today to assess Hume’s – often very uncharitable! – claims about specific religions.)</p>

            <li>Outline two approaches to these questions which we can find elsewhere in Hume:
                <ul>
                    <li>The ‘sensory impressions view’ (esp. from the Treatise.)</li>
                    <li>The ‘passion-based view’ (esp. from Hume’s (1757) <i>Natural History of Religion</i>.)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Argue that the passions-based view provides a more satisfying answer to our two initial questions.</li>
            <li>Say something more general about the form of explanation found in the passion-based (this will have to be brief, today!)</li>

        <p>Religious practices are used to shed light on legal practices in Book 3 of the Treatise:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>This is a kind of superstitious practice in civil laws, and in the laws of nature, resembling the Roman Catholic superstitions in religion. <mark>As the Roman Catholics represent the inconceivable mysteries of the Christian religion, and render them more present to the mind, by a taper, or habit, or grimace, which is suppos’d to resemble them; so lawyers and moralists have run into like inventions for the same reason,</mark> and have endeavour’d by those means to satisfy themselves concerning the transference of property by consent. (Treatise 3.2.4.2)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Q. How does it work?</li>
            <li>A. Transfer of force from the sensory impressions generated by ritual to the associated religious ideas, via their resemblance. (See e.g. Treatise 1.3.8.3)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples: icons? baptism?<br />
            (See also discussion of icons, statues, etc. in <i>Natural History of Religion</i> 5.7.)</p>

        <header><h1 id="assessing-the-sensory-impressions-view">Assessing the sensory impressions view</h1></header><section>
        <p>With respect to our first question:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Why do people go in for rituals in the first place?</li>
            <li>Why think that rituals will take the form assumed by this account? (Not all rituals are straightforwardly symbolic of associated religious ideas.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hume sometimes suggests that worshippers actively aim at strengthening their belief through ritual. This would provide some answer to the above questions, but is it plausibly a widespread motive?</p>
        <p>With respect to our second question:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Why would religious practices be particularly associated with superstition, on this account?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Donald Siebert’s suggestion about enthusiasm and ‘withdrawal from the world of the senses’ may be relevant here. (cf. OSE 76 on ‘unmediated approach’.)</p>

            <li>Religious belief (belief in deity-like entities) is almost, but not quite, universal in humans.</li>
            <li>This is explained by appeal to a set of universal experiences, and a set of human psychological dispositions, which naturally, though not inevitably, lead to belief in powerful invisible beings.</li>

        <blockquote>
            <p>A sacrifice is conceived as a present; and any present is delivered to their deity by destroying it and rendering it useless to men; by burning what is solid, pouring out the liquid, and killing the animate. For want of a better way of doing him service, we do ourselves an injury; and fancy that we thereby express, at least, the heartiness of our good-will and adoration. Thus our mercenary devotion deceives ourselves, and imagines it deceives the deity. (NHR §9, n.51)</p>

        <p>Amoral or counter-moral forms of worship:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>[I]n every religion, however sublime the verbal definition which it gives of its divinity, many of the votaries, perhaps the greatest number, will still seek the divine favour, not by virtue and good morals, which alone can be acceptable to a perfect being, <mark>but either by frivolous observances, by intemperate zeal, by rapturous extasies, or by the belief of mysterious and absurd opinions.</mark> (NHR 14.1)</p>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Basic logic of sacrifice can be extended to cover various forms of self-denial. (esp. ‘Monkish virtues’ of Christianity?)</li>
            <li>Given that virtue is useful and agreeable, acting well is not understood to be done ‘for the sake of’ the deity (NHR 14.6). The effort to do something for the sake of the deity therefore leads away from virtue.</li>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Whatever weakens or disorders the internal frame promotes the interests of superstition: And nothing is more destructive to them than a manly, steady virtue, which either preserves us from disastrous, melancholy accidents, or teaches us to bear them. (NHR 14.8)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But Hume seems to think that even regular (not actively immoral) religious practice, by ‘sacrificing our ease and quiet’ (NHR 14.6) will ‘weaken and disorder the internal frame’.</p>
        <p>So self-denying religious practice has a tendency to exacerbate the very conditions (uncertainty and fear) which gave rise to religious belief in the first place. (Thereby establishing a feedback loop.)</p>
        <p>(See Willem Lemmens (2019) for a slightly different take on this theme.)</p>

        <p>Question: Can this understanding of religious practice shed light on Hume’s other two contrasts between superstition and enthusiasm (concerning connections to priestly and lay authority?)</p>
        <p>Answer: I suspect (and hope to argue in the future) that the passions-based account can help us to understand superstition’s connections with authority, by shedding light on how Hume sees priestly authority as arising in the first place.</p>

        <p>Focus on the role of priests in religious practice highlights their interests (and intentions) in designing and prescribing rituals. This risks overlooking important features of the passion-based account of religious practice in the <i>Natural History</i> (which are signalled in ‘Of Superstition and Enthusiasm’):</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Whilst priests might make use of the power of ritual, Hume explains how these forms might arise without priests.</li>
            <li>Further, the feedback loop of belief and practice can operate without priestly intervention.</li>
            <li>Finally (in contrast with Hume’s remarks in the Treatise about practice being motivated by the desire to strengthen belief) worshippers themselves needn’t intend to affect their belief, or even realise that their actions have this effect.</li>
            <li>Given (1-3), the passion-based account explains the stability of superstition as the robust upshot of systematic but (in principle) wholly unintended consequences of human action.</li>
