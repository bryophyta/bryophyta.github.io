     <h3 class="title-link"><a name="phd">PhD thesis</a></h3>
     <p class="main-text">I am currently writing up my PhD thesis at UCL, which has been supervised by Dr. Douglas Lavin, Prof. Mike Martin, and Prof. Lucy O’Brien. My PhD has been supported by an AHRC studentship through the London Arts and Humanities Partnership, and a Jacobsen bursary from the Royal Institute of Philosophy.</p>
     <p class="main-text">The first part of my thesis develops an ontology of rules, norms, and conventions. Many well-known accounts of convention discuss only conventions which are recognised as such by at least some of those who follow them. By contrast, many of the conventions and norms discussed in the social sciences are ‘implicit’ insofar as they are frequently reproduced by people who do not recognise that they are reproducing a given pattern of behaviour, let alone that they are following a particular convention in doing so. A related limitation consists in a failure to take the <i>ontology</i> of conventions seriously. Many accounts of conventions give conditions for a convention to ‘exist’ in terms of a set of attitudes had towards forms of behaviour by people in a given population. Such accounts will naturally tend towards a focus on those conventions which are recognised as such. However, even when such attitudes are in place, they cannot be <i>identified</i> with the convention itself.   Providing a realistic ontology of conventions allows us to see more easily how they can exist without being recognised as such by those who follow the. Drawing on work by Ruth Millikan, I develop such an ontology.</p>
     <p class="main-text">The second part of the thesis begins to explore some of the implications of the first part for the topic of <i>agency</i> in the context of social practices. I focus here particularly on the case of behavioural rules. Frequently, the non-alienated rule-follower will feel that the rules of some social practice or other <i>require</i> certain behaviours of her. I develop an account of this sense of requirement, and suggest that the ontological account developed in the first part of the thesis is well-placed to explain this aspect of the agent’s practical reasoning. I conclude with some exploration of the relationship between implicit conventions and explicit rules, and the relationship between critical reflection and responsible agency.</p>
     
     <h3 class="title-link"><a name="mphil">MPhil thesis</a></h3>
     <p class="main-text">I gained my MPhil in Philosophy from UCL in 2014. My thesis was titled ‘Delusions, Rationality, and Conceptions of Radical Interpretation’.</p>
     <p class="main-text">This thesis is concerned with the relevance of monothematic delusions, like the Capgras delusion, for understanding the mind. Contrary to various recent claims, I argue that monothematic delusions do not provide an important counterexample to interpretive holism of the kind found in Donald Davidson’s work. However, I develop a new argument against Davidson’s account of the mind, appealing to the kind of <i>explanation</i> required to make sense of such delusions.</p>
