     <p class="main-text">I am currently completing my PhD at UCL. The title of my thesis is 'Convention, Reflection, and Agency'. It has been supervised by Dr. Douglas Lavin, Prof. Mike Martin, and Prof. Lucy O’Brien. My PhD has been supported by an AHRC studentship through the London Arts and Humanities Partnership, and a Jacobsen bursary from the Royal Institute of Philosophy.</p>
     <p class="main-text">Conventions and other social practices are real entities in our social world. They are created through human activity, but they can exist independently of our beliefs about them. They have their own histories.</p>
     <p class="main-text">These points are crucial for understanding the explanatory and normative role of social practices, but they are frequently ommitted from philosophical discussions of the ontology of social practices. My thesis develops a novel account of the ontology of conventions and other social practices which illuminates these important features. It then shows how this ontology can inform our understanding of the explanatory and practical role of conventions, and the nature of implicit norms.</p>
