<!-- I settled on using embedded description lists for this entry, for now. It seems the most obviously semantically appropriate way to mark up a list of titles and abstracts. But I was less sure whether it was semantic for associating a year (or publication status) with a (description) list of publication titles and abstracts. I doubt anyone will ever read this, but if you do I would be interested in hearing any thoughts on whether this is good semantic HTML or not! -->

            </dt>
            <dd>Abstract: This paper describes a tension which appears to exist between two elements of Sally
                Haslanger’s view in ‘Cognition as a Social Skill’. The first element is a form of anti-
                individualism which views the cognitive and agential powers of mature human agents
                as the products of enculturation. The second is the suggestion that humans need
                culture in part because shared cultural resources facilitate coordination. The tension
                arises from the individualistic way in which coordination is often understood. I
                elaborate on this claim, before suggesting alternative ways of understanding
                coordination which may avoid the tension. One of the non-individualist approaches
                to coordination and culture draws on the work of anthropologist Mary Douglas,
                which suggests a need to pay greater attention to the metaphysics of groups. Finally,
                I turn to Haslanger’s account of ideology critique, arguing that it reveals the
                particular importance, for critical projects, of attending to the cultural bases for
                solidarity.

            <dt>'Anscombe and the Rules of Ordinary Practices', <i>The Anscombean Mind</i>. Edited by Adrian Haddock and Rachael Wiseman. Routledge.
            </dt>
            <dd>Abstract: In the introduction to the third volume of her collected papers, Elizabeth Anscombe suggests that her earlier account of practical reasoning was limited by her "struggle to treat all deliberate action as a matter of acting on a calculation how to obtain one's ends". As examples of reasoning which cannot be understood in terms of ends-based deliberation, she mentions a number of cases involving what we might think of as 'ordinary rules' -- the rules of games, etiquette, the legal system and so on. Although she never returned to fully develop these remarks, the present paper argues that Anscombe's work contains crucial material required to show the limits of a purely ends-based model of practical reasoning. It then argues that this critique of ends-based reasoning can help us to formulate a puzzle about ordinary rules which still persists in the philosophy of action today.

            <dd>This paper examines Hume's views on social practices in the context of his work on religion, beginning from his claim that regular practices can help to make religious movements more stable over time. A well-known discussion in the <i>Treatise</i> attributes the belief-sustaining role of practices to the association of sensory impressions and ideas. However, this paper argues that in order to understand Hume's broader explanatory claims, we need to pay attention to an overlooked account of religious practice in his work which reserves a key role for the <i>passions</i>.</dd>

<p class="main-text">I recently completed my PhD in Philosophy at UCL. The title of my thesis is 'Convention, Reflection, and Agency'. It has been supervised by Dr. Douglas Lavin, Prof. Mike Martin, and Prof. Lucy O'Brien. My PhD has been supported by an AHRC studentship through the London Arts and Humanities Partnership, and a Jacobsen bursary from the Royal Institute of Philosophy.</p>
<p class="main-text">Conventions and other social practices are real entities in our social world. They are created through human activity, but they can exist independently of our beliefs about them. They have their own histories.</p>
<p class="main-text">These points are crucial for understanding the explanatory and normative role of social practices, but they are frequently omitted from philosophical discussions of the ontology of such practices. My thesis develops a novel account of the ontology of conventions and other social practices which illuminates these important features. It then shows how this ontology can inform our understanding of the explanatory and practical role of conventions, and the nature of implicit norms.</p>
