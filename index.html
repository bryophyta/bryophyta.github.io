	I am in the final stages of my PhD in Philosophy at University College London.  The title of my thesis is 'Convention, Reflection, and Agency'. Before undertaking the PhD I earned an MPhil in Philosophy, also at UCL, in 2014. My BA was in Philosophy & Literature, from the University of Warwick.

	My current research focuses on an intersection between social ontology and the philosophy of action. It asks what rules, norms, and conventions are, and how they impact on our practical reasoning and other facets of agency. I see this research as contributing towards a broader project of understanding the nature of culture, and the ways in which cultural context affects individual agency.

	I also have interests in philosophy of mind, philosophy of psychiatry, Wittgenstein, G. E. M. Anscombe, technology & culture, feminist theory, and social and cultural anthropology.
