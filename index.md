Hi, my name is Pete. I'm a software developer based in the UK.

There's a small chance that you're looking for something relating to [my
philosophical work](philosophy.md). If so, please feel to reach out! I'm always
happy to talk philosophy, even if I don't find so much time for it these days.

If you're interested in where the username 'bryophyta' comes from, I picked it
because it's the word for the family of plants that mosses belong to. I can't
claim deep knowledge about mosses, but they're pretty great! If you're
interested in learning more about them, I can heartily recommend Robin Wall
Kimmerer's wonderful book [_Gathering Moss: A Natural and Cultural History of
Mosses_](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/444764/gathering-moss-by-kimmerer-robin-wall/){ext}.
