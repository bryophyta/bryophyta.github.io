        <dt>'Coordination and the Need for Culture', <i>Australasian Philosophical Review</i>.
        </dt>
        <dd>Abstract: This paper describes a tension which appears to exist between two elements of Sally
            Haslanger’s view in ‘Cognition as a Social Skill’. The first element is a form of anti-
            individualism which views the cognitive and agential powers of mature human agents
            as the products of enculturation. The second is the suggestion that humans need
            culture in part because shared cultural resources facilitate coordination. The tension
            arises from the individualistic way in which coordination is often understood. I
            elaborate on this claim, before suggesting alternative ways of understanding
            coordination which may avoid the tension. One of the non-individualist approaches
            to coordination and culture draws on the work of anthropologist Mary Douglas,
            which suggests a need to pay greater attention to the metaphysics of groups. Finally,
            I turn to Haslanger’s account of ideology critique, arguing that it reveals the
            particular importance, for critical projects, of attending to the cultural bases for
            solidarity.

        <dt>'Anscombe and the Rules of Ordinary Practices', <i>The Anscombean Mind</i>. Edited by Adrian Haddock and Rachael Wiseman. Routledge.
        </dt>
        <dd>Abstract: In the introduction to the third volume of her collected papers, Elizabeth Anscombe suggests that her earlier account of practical reasoning was limited by her "struggle to treat all deliberate action as a matter of acting on a calculation how to obtain one's ends". As examples of reasoning which cannot be understood in terms of ends-based deliberation, she mentions a number of cases involving what we might think of as 'ordinary rules' -- the rules of games, etiquette, the legal system and so on. Although she never returned to fully develop these remarks, the present paper argues that Anscombe's work contains crucial material required to show the limits of a purely ends-based model of practical reasoning. It then argues that this critique of ends-based reasoning can help us to formulate a puzzle about ordinary rules which still persists in the philosophy of action today.

        <dt>'[Title Removed]' (Under review; .pdf available on request.)</dt>
        <dd>This paper examines Hume's views on social practices in the context of his work on religion, beginning from his claim that regular practices can help to make religious movements more stable over time. A well-known discussion in the <i>Treatise</i> attributes the belief-sustaining role of practices to the association of sensory impressions and ideas. However, this paper argues that in order to understand Hume's broader explanatory claims, we need to pay attention to an overlooked account of religious practice in his work which reserves a key role for the <i>passions</i>.</dd>
